title: Conditional comments
---

Conditional comments have the same syntax as an HTML comment (`<!-- -->`), but they only work on the Internet Explorer browser (IE).
Despite the fact that the technique isn't used on the web nowadays, I still keep it here to remind us of what we had to deal with many years ago.

The content inside the comments are only available on IE 5-9, and are ignored by other browsers. In the older versions of IE, starting from IE 10, the syntax is disabled.

```html
<!--[if IE]>Only IE sees this<![endif]-->
```

You are able to add some constraint to restricts the IE versions, for example:

```html
<!--[if IE 8]>Only IE 8 sees this<![endif]-->

<!--[if gte IE 8]>Only IE 8 and higher versions see this<![endif]-->

<!--[if lte IE 8]>Only IE 8 and lower versions see this<![endif]-->
```

The special characters indicating the IE versions are listed as following:

| Character | Description              |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| `gt`      | Greater than             |
| `gte`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `lt`      | Less than                |
| `lte`     | Less than or equal to    |

You can apply styles or fixes for a given IE version such as

```html
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!--[if IE 8]>
    <link href="fix-ie8.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<![endif]-->

<!--[if IE 9]>
    <link href="fix-ie9.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<![endif]-->
```

The `styles.css` file contains the styles working for modern browsers whereas `fix-ie8.css` and `fix-ie9.css` files provide the fixes for IE 8 and IE 9 respectively.
