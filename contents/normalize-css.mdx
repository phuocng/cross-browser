title: Normalize CSS
---

Each browser provides a set of default styles which are applied for every web page it renders. The default style sheet is also known as the user-agent style sheet.
For example, here is the default styles provided by popular browsers:

-   [Chrome default styles](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/master/Source/core/css/html.css)
-   [Firefox default styles](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/res/html.css)
-   [Safari default styles](https://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css)

Since they aren't the same as each other, a web page looks differently on each browser. Normalizing CSS is a technique to fix the issue. It tries to make the default styles of native elements consistently cross browsers.

For example, we can use the HTML 5 `hidden` attribute to hide an element completely:

```html
<input type="text" hidden />
```

However, the attribute isn't supported on IE 10. So we should include the following declaration:

```css
[hidden] {
    display: none;
}
```

[normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) is a popular library providing these kinds of fixes. If you take a look at [its source code](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css), you'll realize that
there are lot of bug fixes for different browsers such as IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari there.

Popular CSS libraries include or build their normalized CSS on top of `normalize.css`, for example:

-   [Bootstrap's reboot](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_reboot.scss)
-   [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/blob/main/src/_normalize.css)
-   [TailwindCSS's preflight](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/src/css/preflight.css)
